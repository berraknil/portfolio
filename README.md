I used NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day [API](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html) for this application. It relies on jQuery for the AJAX calls and for toggling the info and HD photo options, and the moment.js library for the date change functionality.

I built this markdown preview application using React and the additional Remarkable component. It has a built in ES6 template literal to show a sample text written with markdown on first load. This application only supports desktop and tablet layouts for the time being.
