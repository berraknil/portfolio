![Soundminer Alloy](./images/smartmockups_jj46f83f.png)

Fetching data from the WordPress REST API for the Menu, About and Contact pages. Using Axios for API calls, redux-promise as the Redux middleware to resolve promises and React-Router-Dom (new in React-Router v4) for routing. Deployed using Zeit's Now.

 Alloy is a customizable and distributable web based search app that enables Soundminer users to access and
 use their audio files and playlists on the cloud. The project itself required a fast and easy to use UI combined
 with complete control of the backend API. 
        
 As the main frontend developer on Alloy, I designed and implemented the UI, was responsible for features such
 as text search, facet search/tag filtering, creating an audio waveform visualizer for the currently playing
 audio track, creation and manipulation of user playlists, with features such as downloading, deleting and
 adding tracks to the playlists and many more.
           
 The project is built with React, Redux and React-Router v4 among many other modern web technologies, and was
 a project that enabled me to merge my two passions, audio and UI development.
